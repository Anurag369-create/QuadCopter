# Experimental Quadcopter â€“ Teensy + FS-i6 (PPM Mode)

This project is an **experimental quadcopter flight controller** built around a **Teensy microcontroller** and the **FlySky FS-i6 transmitter/receiver system**.  
The goal is to design, test, and document a custom control stack for multirotors, focusing on **lightweight firmware**, **sensor fusion**, and **PPM-based receiver decoding**.

## ðŸ›  Hardware

- **MCU**: Teensy (e.g., Teensy 4.0 / 4.1, ARM Cortex-M7)  
- **Transmitter/Receiver**: FlySky FS-i6 + FS-iA6B in **PPM mode**  
- **IMU Sensor**: MPU6050 / MPU9250 (for gyro + accelerometer data)  
- **Motors**: Brushless DC motors with ESCs  
- **Power**: LiPo battery (3S/4S depending on design)  
- **Frame**: 250â€“450mm experimental quadcopter frame
